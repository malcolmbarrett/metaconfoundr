Description: Visualize 'confounder' control in meta-analysis.
    'metaconfoundr' is an approach to evaluating bias in studies used in
    meta-analyses based on the causal inference framework. Study groups
    create a causal diagram displaying their assumptions about the
    scientific question. From this, they develop a list of important
    'confounders'. Then, they evaluate whether studies controlled for
    these variables well. 'metaconfoundr' is a toolkit to facilitate this
    process and visualize the results as heat maps, traffic light plots,
    and more.
